# recorderMock.js

recorderMock.js is a helper library for creating mock objects that
silently receive and record any call that they're configured for.

The intended use for this is to mock out libraries that interact
with browser APIs (e.g., jQuery, RaphaÃ«l). Doing this with standard
mocking tools tends to lead to a lot of extra setup code, whereas
recorderMock.js often only requires a single line.

## Usage

To build a mock object, just call the `recorderMock` function with
all the functions you want to mock:

    var myMock = recorderMock("foo", "bar");

You can then call the defined methods as usual, or chained:

    myMock.foo();
    myMock.bar().foo("some arg");

An inspect the calls that were made after the fact:

    myMock.foo.__calls    // => [{arguments: []}, {arguments: ["some arg"]}]
    myMock.bar.__calls    // => [{arguments: []}]

You can also call the mock directly which is useful with some libraries:

    myMock("another arg")
    myMock.__calls        // => [{arguments: ["another arg"]}]

## Compatibility

The tests are currently running in-browser, rhino, and node.js, so it should
work pretty much anywhere. Let me know if you find otherwise.
